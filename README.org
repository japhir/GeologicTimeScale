#+title: Make a nice Geologic Time Scale

In this repository I create a nice PDF on A3 size to print the Geologic Time Scale on a linear scale, so that it doesn't seem like the recent time periods took the same amount of time as the Precambrian.

I had to copy over all the colours and age ranges, because the official tools only provide a PDF.

If you want to use this figure for your own plots you can either:

1. load in the ~GTS_widths.csv~ file and plot it yourself
   #+begin_src R
     library(readr)
     GTS <- read_csv("https://github.com/japhir/GeologicTimeScale/raw/master/GTS_widths.csv")
     # create plot yourself
   #+end_src

2. load in the ~gts_plot.rds~ file and tweak the plot itself.
#+begin_src R
  library(ggplot2)
  library(readr)
  gts <- read_rds()
#+end_src
